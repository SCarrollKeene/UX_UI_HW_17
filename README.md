# Mock UX/UI Portfolio Site 

This github page is meant to serve as a very base mockup
for the creation of my UX/UI Portfolio site using HTML & CSS.

[Link to site: click here](https://scarrollkeene.github.io/UX_UI_HW_17/)

**- do note that it is in no way made to be responsive
so no media queries, grid or css flexbox.**
